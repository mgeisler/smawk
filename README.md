This crate contains an implementation of the [SMAWK algorithm][smawk]
for finding the smallest element per row in a totally monotone matrix.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
smawk = "0.1"
```
and this to your crate root:
```rust
extern crate smawk;
```

You can now efficiently find row and column minima. Here is an example
where we find the column minima:

```rust
extern crate ndarray;
extern crate smawk;

use ndarray::arr2;
use smawk::smawk_column_minima;

let matrix = arr2(&[
    [3, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    [2, 1, 3, 3, 4],
    [2, 1, 3, 3, 4],
    [3, 2, 4, 3, 4],
    [4, 3, 2, 1, 1],
]);
let minima = vec![1, 1, 4, 4, 4];
assert_eq!(smawk_column_minima(&matrix), minima);
```

The `minima` vector gives the index of the minimum value per column,
so `minima[0] == 1` since the minimum value in the first column is 2
(row 1). Note that the smallest row index is returned.
